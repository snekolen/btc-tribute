                        Hello!  I'm Helen Ma and am currently a sophomore at Texas A&M University looking to change my major to Computer 
                        Engineering or related fields and earn minor in Cybersecurity.  My goal is to become software developer after graduation.  
                        <br />
                        I found my passion for programming through developing web pages during my senior year of high school 
                        and thus decided to pursue Computer Science.  My interests lie in software, systems, and digital ethics, and my work is 
                        a relection of my progress in those fields.
                        <br />
                        My hobbies include crocheting stuffed animals, cooking, and working out.
                        </p>

                        Muse is a Discord bot that sends music based on user-inputted countries and decades and keeps track of top 
                        search terms and recently liked songs in a server.  This bot uses Discord's API to send messages based on  
                        an user's input that it reads.  Muse uses Musicbrainz to search up songs from a certain country and decade 
                        and searches YouTube for a link for that song.  Additionally, it pulls up a list of countries that existed 
                        during decades after the 1900s and top searched and recently liked songs among all servers Muse has been 
                        invited to.

                        MazeBot is maze traversal robot that uses LIDAR sensors to navigate through any given maze.  It is a collaborative 
                        project of students of TURTLE robotics from computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and 
                        related majors.  Mazebot is run using a Nvidia Jetson computer and the final product is ensured to have perfect 
                        accuracy by using data gathered by previous trials.  This project is currently a work in progress.

                        <p>
                        Local Flights is a web app that shows data of arriving and departing flights of airports around world.  Users first search 
                        for a certain airport, and data of current flights are collected, which include starting and end locations of each flight.  
                        The data is then put in a visual that shows all incoming and outgoing flights out of the inputted airport.  The idea for Local 
                        Flights originated from TAMUhack, and is still a work in progress.
